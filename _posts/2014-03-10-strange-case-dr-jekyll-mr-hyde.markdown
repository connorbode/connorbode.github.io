I've been meaning to start up a blog for a while, because it's what [real programmers](http://verybadalloc.com/blog/2014/03/18/i-dont-want-to-be-a-real-programmer/) do! 

The blog is powered by [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) and hosted on Github.  Feel free to view the [blog's source](http://github.com/connorbode/connorbode.github.io).

Side note: I went on a Googley mission to discover more about Dr. Jekyll & Mr. Hyde because I only know them from [The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0311429/).  On my mission, I found [this gem](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EugSL1jbUE0).

__And so begins my coding blog!  Muahaha.__
