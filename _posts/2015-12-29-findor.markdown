### Overview

[Findor](http://findor.com/) was my main project during 2014 and 2015.  The project is maintained by [EightySix Labs](http://eightysixlabs.com/). 

The main purpose of the application was to bundle event admissions with airfare and accomodations.  A customized web portal was provided for each of the events we worked with.

I built a prototype in early 2014 using AngularJS with a minimal Python / Django backend.  The application was expanded in 2015 as it gained traction.
