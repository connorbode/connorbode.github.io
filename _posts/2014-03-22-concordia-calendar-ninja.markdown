This project was inspired by Concordia University's [Software Engineering and Computer Science Society (SCS)](http://scs.ecaconcordia.ca/).  I was working on the project at an SCS hackathon two years ago ([see the repo](https://github.com/SCS-hackers-group/Schedule-To-Calendar)), but there hasn't been any progress on it since.  I needed an idea for a demo project, so I just stole this one!

The purpose of this project is to log in to a Concordia student's MyConcordia profile, retrieve that student's course schedule for a given semester and import the schedule to a Google Calendar account.  It relieves the user of a tedious task.
