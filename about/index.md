I'm an [Angular.js](https://angularjs.org/) developer at [Eightysix Labs](http://eightysixlabs.com) and a computer science student at [Concordia University](http://www.concordia.ca/) in Montreal, QC.  About me pages really irk me, so I'll just answer [some questions](http://www.humorthatworks.com/how-to/50-questions-to-get-to-know-someone/) instead:

__What sound do you love?__ The silence at the top of a mountain.  [Powder screams](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUuVhiXe33Q#t=0m37s).  [Fast drums](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3f8VUZ5xAU#t=0m05s).

__Is a picture worth a thousand words?__ There's a period of my life where I wasn't taking many pictures.  I honestly forget what happened.  I really value photostreams -- they're modern journals.

__Whereâ€™s Waldo?__ I saw lots of them at [Burning Man](https://www.google.ca/search?q=waldo+burning+man&es_sm=91&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ei=uVJ9U5evAZaoyAS9kIHACQ&ved=0CAgQ_AUoAQ&biw=1280&bih=610).

__The best part of waking up is?__ Generally coffee, but sometimes surfing or snowboarding.


I've got a few [side projects](/projects) on the go, but I spend most of my free time trying to escape civilization for a canoe trip or the like.  I'm a challenge junkie and love everything from slacklining to snowboarding.  Finally, I'm a very malleable person who's perspective changes drastically every 6 month stretch.  I'm always seeking inspiration, alternative views & wisdom.
